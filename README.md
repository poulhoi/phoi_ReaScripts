# phoi_ReaScripts

This repository contains my public scripts for Reaper. I hope they will be useful to people.

### Installation instructions:

I recommend installing these scripts through [ReaPack](https://reapack.com).

- Open Reaper (!).
- Go to Extensions -> ReaPack -> Manage repositories...
- Click on Import/export -> Import repositories...
- Copy the following URL into the text field: https://github.com/poulhoi/phoi_ReaScripts/raw/master/index.xml
- Hit 'OK'.

Tested only on MacOS Mojave for now, but everything should work on Windows and possibly Linux as well.
Feel free to reach out to [me on the Reaper forums](https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=140016) if you have questions or problems.

Cheers,

Poul
