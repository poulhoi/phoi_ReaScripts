# phoi_ReaScripts

This repository contains my public scripts for Reaper. I hope they will be useful to people.

### Installation instructions:
- Open Reaper (!).
- Go to Extensions -> ReaPack -> Manage repositories...
- Click on Import/export -> Import repositories...
- Copy the following URL into the text field: https://github.com/poulhoi/phoi_ReaScripts/raw/master/index.xml
- Hit 'OK'.

Tested only on MacOS Mojave for now, but everything should work on Windows and possibly Linux as well.
Feel free to reach out to me on the Reaper forums if you have questions or problems: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=140016

Cheers,

Poul
